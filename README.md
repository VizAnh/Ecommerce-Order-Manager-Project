# Ecommerce-Order-Manager-Project
This project is a database application designed to manage customers, orders, products and quantities. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to enable users to interact with the database more intuitively, including viewing data tables, inserting new records, updating existing information, and performing filtered searches.
